## üå± About Me

I am currently a **first-year Master's student** in **Computer Science - System Architecture**

##  üóÇÔ∏è Repositories

I organize my school repositories based on my academic year. You can recognize them as they start with the following prefixes:

* **b1**: Projects from my first year of Bachelor's degree
* **b2**: Projects from my second year of Bachelor's degree
* **b3**: Projects from my third year of Bachelor's degree
* **masi4**: Projects from my first year of Master's degree
* **masi5**: Projects from my second year of Master's degree

Repositories that do not start with these prefixes correspond to my personal projects or side experiments.

* Backend Development üõ†Ô∏è
