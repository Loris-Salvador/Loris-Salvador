## 🌱 About Me

##  🗂️ Repositories

I organize my school repositories based on my academic year. You can recognize them as they start with the following prefixes:

* **b1**: Projects from my first year of Bachelor's degree

Repositories that do not start with these prefixes correspond to my personal projects or side experiments.
