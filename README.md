## 👋 About Me

I am currently a **last-year Master's student** in **Computer Science - System Architecture**

##  🗂️ Repositories

I organize my school repositories based on my academic year. You can recognize them as they start with the following prefixes:

* **b**: Projects from my Bachelor's degreee
* **masi**: Projects from my Master's degree

Repositories that do not start with these prefixes correspond to my personal projects or side experiments.
